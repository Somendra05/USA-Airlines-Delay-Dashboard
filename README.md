 ✈️ USA Airlines Delay Dashboard

 🛠️ Built with Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, and Matplotlib

 📌 Project Overview
The USA Airlines Delay Dashboard provides an interactive visualization of airline delays in the United States. This project aims to analyze trends, identify the worst-performing airlines and airports, and explore the causes of flight delays.

🔗 Live Demo: [USA Airlines Delay Dashboard](https://usa-airlines-delay-dashboard.streamlit.app/)

 🎯 Key Features  
✅ Interactive Filters – Filter by airline and airport to customize insights  
✅ Top 10 Worst Airports & Airlines – Identify the biggest delay contributors  
✅ Average Delay Time – Visualize airlines with the longest delays  
✅ Breakdown of Delay Causes – Understand primary reasons for delays  
✅ Monthly Delay Trends – See delay patterns over time  
✅ Dark-Themed UI – Aesthetic and user-friendly dashboard  

 📊 Dataset
The analysis is based on publicly available airline delay data stored in a CSV file. The dataset includes:
- `carrier_name` – Name of the airline
- `airport_name` – Name of the airport
- `arr_del15` – Number of arrival delays (15+ minutes)
- `arr_delay` – Average delay time in minutes
- `carrier_ct`, `weather_ct`, `nas_ct`, `security_ct`, `late_aircraft_ct` – Causes of flight delays
- `month` – Month of travel
